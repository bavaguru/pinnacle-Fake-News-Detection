# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on identifying fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The model is trained to differentiate between **real** and **fake** news based on textual content.

---

## ✅ Project Overview

- 🔍 **Goal**: Classify news articles as Fake or Real.
- 📚 **Dataset**: Combination of `Fake.csv` and `True.csv`.
- 🧠 **Model Used**: Logistic Regression (also compared with SVM and Naive Bayes).
- 📊 **Techniques**: TF-IDF Vectorization, Confusion Matrix, Word Clouds.
